I am a senior economist at the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/">Bank of Canada</a>. At the Bank of Canada my research focusses on empirical research in financial markets. 
I specifically concentrate on studying extreme events through extreme value theory (EVT). Furthermore, I focus on the information structure of OTC markets. In further 
ongoing research I study the effect of monetary policy on the market quality in bond markets via the securities lending market. 
For a more extended overview of my working papers and work in progress I refer you to the research section or my resume 
<a href="Files/CV_Ergun_2019.pdf">here (CV)</a>.

I am currently affiliated with the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/">Bank of Canada</a> and to the <a href="http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk/">LSE/Systemic Risk Centre (SRC)</a>.
